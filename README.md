# NEO-SmoothTween
This is a Tween module that will force server tweens into the client for MAXIMIUM SMOOTHNESS

# Instalation
### Adding to your Roblox Project
##### Adding through github files

##### Adding directly from the module asset

### Using the module without Project Installation
Just put `local ST = require(8403027349)` into any **SERVER** script and you're good to go!
Don't worry about it overloading your game with tons of modules/instances, the script will detect if its already loaded, if not then it will load a new instance
